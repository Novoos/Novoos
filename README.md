## About
Novoos is releasing several Branches within its ecosystem, the first is **[NovoPad](https://docs.novoos.net/novopad/next-gen-launchpad)**, the next generation of launchpads.

$NOVO will also be changing the way individuals socialize online, the Novoos project enables users to protect their own data and prevent unwanted privacy breaches from any large or small entity.

Additionally, the ecosystem will initially consist of several components to compile true freedom and secure platforms which combine unique and essential modules as the driving force for $NOVO with continuous growth.
